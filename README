NAME
    Sys::Prctl - Give access to prctl system call from Perl

DESCRIPTION
    This is simple module that wraps the prctl system call. Currently only
    the PR_SET_NAME and PR_GET_NAME are implemented.

    This can be use to change the process name as reported by "ps -A" and be
    killable will killall.

SYNOPSIS
      use Sys::Prctl(prctl_name);
  
      #
      # Use with functions
      # 

      # Process name is now "My long process name"
      my $oldname = prctl_name();
      prctl_name("My long process name");

      #
      # Use as an object
      #
  
      my $process = new Sys::Prctl();

      # Process name is now "Short name"
      my $oldname = $process->name();
      $process->name('Short name');

      #
      # Real world use
      #

      # instead of "perl helloworld.pl"
      $0 = "helloworld"
      prctl_name("helloworld");

      print "Hello World\n";
      sleep 100;

      # Process can now be killed with "killall helloworld"
